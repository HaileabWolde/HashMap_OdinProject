# HashMap are ways of storing data based on keys for a better search speed and saves us a ton of time and space 
# we can imagine HashMap like a librerist trying to give us the book we need if the books are organized in way that are easy to find later on it wouldn't take the librariean so much time to give us the book we need that is the same thing here to for Hashmaps.
# so it gives each index in the array a specfiec hashed code that is unqiue to that index to find it easier later on.
# so How does it work? we would have Bucket, which is value storer inside the index and we would have hash function that hash the key and would give us an index on which the key-value pair would be stored and when we start to search that key-value pair we would hash the key and know which index exactly contains the value.
